# Microblogger

The migroblogger is a simple microblogging platform that allows users to post short messages and view a timeline of posts. 
It is built using Python and Streamlit, with an in-memory data store for simplicity. 

For students, it serves as a practical example of a web application which can be extended with more features like user authentication, message deletion, and more.
